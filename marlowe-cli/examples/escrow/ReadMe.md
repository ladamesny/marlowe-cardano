# Example Escrow Contract

This escrow contract is for the purchase of an item at a price. The buyer may complain that there is a problem, asking for a refund. If the seller disputes that complaint, then a mediator decides.
There are four potential outcomes:

*   ["Everything is alright"](everything-is-alright.md): no problem.
*   ["Confirm problem"](confirm-problem.md): seller agrees that there is a problem.
*   ["Dismiss claim"](dismiss-claim.md): mediator decides in favor of seller.
*   ["Confirm claim"](confirm-claim.md): mediator decides in favor of buyer.

The following flow chart illustrates the actions and decisions involved.
